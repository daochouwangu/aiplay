Ultralytics YOLO11 is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and improvements to further boost performance and flexibility. YOLO11 is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and tracking, instance segmentation, image classification and pose estimation tasks.

We hope that the resources here will help you get the most out of YOLO. Please browse the Ultralytics Docs for details, raise an issue on GitHub for support, questions, or discussions, become a member of the Ultralytics Discord, Reddit and Forums!

To request an Enterprise License please complete the form at Ultralytics Licensing.

Documentation
See below for a quickstart install and usage examples, and see our Docs for full documentation on training, validation, prediction and deployment.

Install
Pip install the ultralytics package including all requirements in a Python>=3.8 environment with PyTorch>=1.8.

PyPI - Version Downloads PyPI - Python Version

pip install ultralytics
For alternative installation methods including Conda, Docker, and Git, please refer to the Quickstart Guide.

Conda Version Docker Image Version

Usage
CLI
YOLO may be used directly in the Command Line Interface (CLI) with a yolo command:

yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
yolo can be used for a variety of tasks and modes and accepts additional arguments, i.e. imgsz=640. See the YOLO CLI Docs for examples.

Python
YOLO may also be used directly in a Python environment, and accepts the same arguments as in the CLI example above:

from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model

model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Train the model

train_results = model.train(
data="coco8.yaml", # path to dataset YAML
epochs=100, # number of training epochs
imgsz=640, # training image size
device="cpu", # device to run on, i.e. device=0 or device=0,1,2,3 or device=cpu
)

# Evaluate model performance on the validation set

metrics = model.val()

# Perform object detection on an image

results = model("path/to/image.jpg")
results[0].show()

# Export the model to ONNX format

path = model.export(format="onnx") # return path to exported model
See YOLO Python Docs for more examples.

Models
YOLO11 Detect, Segment and Pose models pretrained on the COCO dataset are available here, as well as YOLO11 Classify models pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Track mode is available for all Detect, Segment and Pose models.

Ultralytics YOLO supported tasks

All Models download automatically from the latest Ultralytics release on first use.

Detection (COCO)
See Detection Docs for usage examples with these models trained on COCO, which include 80 pre-trained classes.
